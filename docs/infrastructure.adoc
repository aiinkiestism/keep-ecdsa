== Deployment Considerations

// TODO: Flesh out this document

=== Kubernetes

At Keep we run on GCP + Kube. To accommodate the aforementioned system considerations we use the following pattern for each of our environments:

- Regional Kube cluster.
- 5 ECDSA clients, each running minimum stake required by the network.
- A LoadBalancer Service for each client.
- A StatefulSet for each client.

You can see our Ropsten Kube configurations https://github.com/keep-network/keep-ecdsa/tree/master/infrastructure/kube/keep-test[here]
