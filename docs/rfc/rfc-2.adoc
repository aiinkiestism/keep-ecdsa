== Background

The Keep ECDSA client is a generic client for ECDSA keeps, which are on-chain
smart contract representations of a signing group that can provide on-demand
key generation and signature services for a consumer application (represented
by another smart contract). These applications occasionally require
application-specific functionality that is best handled by the ECDSA client.
tBTC is one such application that requires certain functionality specific to
it implemented in the ECDSA client. RFC 1 describes an approach for handling
certain, but not all, tBTC-specific functionality.

In the Ethereum deployment of the tBTC system, the ECDSA keeps secure their
correct operation by putting up collateral in the form of ETH on Ethereum. In
cases where the collateral becomes insufficient for the tBTC system to
guarantee its invariants (an amount that is controllable in the tBTC contracts),
the tBTC system is authorized to _seize_ this collateral, and begin an auction
process to bring itself back into balance.

In these scenarios, the ECDSA keep signers are in control of BTC that can be
split among their owners. This RFC seeks to outline a tBTC-specific
functionality that would allow the clients in the signer group to
automatically recover the BTC to designated addresses on the Bitcoin chain.

=== Current Functionality

ECDSA clients currently monitor the chain for notifications that a Keep has
closed abnormally, in particular in the function
https://github.com/keep-network/keep-ecdsa/blob/b916eaa491b886fb6c7cde2706d225b5b85ac2a2/pkg/client/client.go#L778[`monitorKeepTerminatedEvent`].
For tBTC, a termination indicates that the keep backing a deposit has been
closed without a successful redemption, meaning that the keep still holds
BTC. Upon receiving a termination event, the client waits for a set number of
block confirmations to occur in order to be sure the event will not be
reorged away, then archives its key material, removes the keep from the local
list of active keeps, and finally stops monitoring for any other events
related to that keep.

Notably absent in the current ECDSA client's feature set is any interaction
with the Bitcoin chain. In particular, the ECDSA client does not contain any
functionality for connecting to a Bitcoin node, nor does it at any point
assemble Bitcoin data.

== Proposal

=== Goal

This proposal is focused on achieving a "least effort" implementation of a
recovery protocol that can handle happy paths for BTC distribution. Where
relevant, it points out _unhappy_ paths and may outline how they might be
dealt with in the future, but these unhappy paths are explicitly considered
out of scope for this RFC.

Additionally, this proposal avoids _strictly requiring_ a connection to a
Bitcoin node, as that is an additional piece of infrastructure that triggers
additional requirements for larger staking providers that may be operating
many nodes on behalf of multiple stakers.

=== Implementation

It is important to observe that interaction with the Bitcoin chain is
_strictly unnecessary_ to construct and sign a Bitcoin transaction that
transmits the BTC held by a keep to n addresses, split evenly.

==== Bitcoin Transaction Requirements

The specific goal to recover BTC from a terminated keep is an N-way split of
the BTC, ~1/N going to each of the N signers in the signing group. To do this, a
Bitcoin transaction can be constructed with a single input (the UTXO that funded
the tBTC deposit) and N outputs (one for each signer). A fee, F, is subtracted
from the deposit's lot size, L, and (L-F)/N BTC is sent to each signer.

To compute the per-signer amount, the client needs to know:

- N, the number of signers in the group.
- F, the desired fee.
- L, the deposit lot size.

Separately from the amount, the Bitcoin sighash must be computed in order to
construct a transaction that can spend the tBTC deposit's UTXO; see the tBTC
spec's section on https://docs.keep.network/tbtc/#sighash[Standardized
Sighash Construction] for an introduction to this process. Computing the sighash
requires two additional pieces of data:

- The previous outpoint, which is the concatenation of the funding UTXO's
  32-byte little-endian transaction hash followed by the 4-byte little-endian
  index of the output pointing to the funding UTXO.
- The previous output script, which is to say the address of the deposit.

Notably, both of these pieces of data can be retrieved or computed solely
from data available on the tBTC deposit contract (the previous outpoint
cannot be retrieved solely from the ECDSA keep contract, but requires the
associated tBTC deposit contract).

Finally, once the per-signer amount and sighash are both known, constructing the
signed Bitcoin transaction requires a few more pieces of information:

- The signature of the sighash, which must be generated via the threshold ECDSA
  functionality of the keep.
- The public key of the current holder, which in this case is the keep and
  should be computable locally by each signer.
- For each of the signers, a Bitcoin address to receive the split amount.

==== Required Inputs

From this, we reach the full set of required inputs and where they can be
procured or computed:

- N, the number of signers in the group, available on the Keep contract
  from the `getMembers` view method, but also tracked locally on the client
  alongside the members of the keep.
- L, the deposit lot size, available on the tBTC deposit contract from the
  `lotSizeSatoshis` view method.
- The previous outpoint describing the deposit UTXO, available on the tBTC
  deposit contract from the `fundingInfo` view method, which returns it as
  the third `utxoOutpoint` entry in its 3-part return tuple.
- The keep's public key, available on the Keep contract from the
  `getPublicKey` view method.
- The deposit redemption script, straightforwardly computable from the keep's
  public key by compressing the public key; this is briefly covered in the
  implementation <<output-script>> section.
- One Bitcoin address per signer, specified on the client in a way detailed
  in the section on <<recovery-address>>.
- The keep's signature on the sighash produced by the previous items,
  computed via the threshold ECDSA protocol in a way detailed in the section on
  the <<signing-protocol>>.
- F, the desired fee, which is a function of the going feerate on the Bitcoin
  network and the number of bytes in the final transaction.

The desired fee is the most problematic one to procure under the goal of not
strictly requiring a Bitcoin node connection, as generally a Bitcoin node
provides estimates of the feerates that will achieve transaction confirmation
within a certain amount of time. A short-term solution is proposed in the
section on <<bitcoin-fee>>.

[[recovery-address]]
===== Specifying an Operator's Bitcoin Recovery Address

To specify a given operator's Bitcoin Recovery Address, this proposal
suggests adding a single key to the `Extensions.TBTC.BTCRefunds` config
entry, `BeneficiaryAddress`. The value for this key should be one of:

- A simple BTC address.
- An xpub, ypub, or zpub that allows the client to derive new addresses for
  each refund.

The challenge with a *pub is that, to avoid reuse, it needs to do one of two
things:

- Be able to check, on-chain, whether a given address has been used; or,
- Have a *pub that is only meant for use by the client, and have the client
  track the latest address generated (as an index starting at 0).

To avoid _strictly requiring_ a connection to a Bitcoin node, this RFC
proposes tracking the latest address generated, and allowing an additional
config key, `TargetDerivationStartIndex`, that sets a starting point for such
derivations. The client should write the updated index to the `current/`
directory that tracks active key shares, to an encrypted file named
`current-btc-refund-derivation-index`. The operator should then seek to
obtain from the staker an extended public key that is only used for this
purpose.

If an optional Bitcoin node connection is available (see <<electrs>>), the
client should additionally check a derived address for a balance before
publishing. To do this, a GET request to `/address/<address>` should be issued,
and the JSON response inspected for a `tx_count` of 0.

==== Modification of key material archiving

In the current client, key material is archived as soon as the ECDSA keep
contract a client is participating in moves into the CLOSED or TERMINATED
state. This RFC revises that behavior to only archive on transition to CLOSED.
When contracts transition into TERMINATED state and that transition is
confirmed (by waiting
https://github.com/keep-network/keep-ecdsa/blob/master/pkg/client/client.go#L28-L31[`blockConfirmation`
blocks]), the client should immediately begin <<bitcoin-fee,Bitcoin fee
resolution>> followed by the <<signing-protocol>> and finally
<<transaction-submission,transaction submission>>. Only when signing and
transaction submission (whether via logging or API) completes or times out
should the associated key material be archived.

On startup, if a client sees that an unarchived keep is in the TERMINATED
state and has been in that state for `blockConfirmation` blocks, it should
move directly to <<bitcoin-fee,Bitcoin fee resolution>>, unless an optional
Bitcoin node connection is available (see <<electrs>>). In this case, the
client should check the keep's associated deposit for an unspent balance by
issuing a GET request to `/tx/:txid/outspend/:vout`, using the deposit's
`fundingInfo().utxoOutpoint` to derive the transaction id and vout, and only
start the signing process if the JSON result has a `spent` value of false. If
`spent` is `true` and `status.confirmed` is `false`, a retry should occur
after an hour until `spent` is `true`, `status.confirmed` is `true`, and
`status.block_height` is at least 6 blocks past the value returned by issuing
a GET request to `/blocks/tip/height`. If this occurs, the key material
should be archived.

Note that the output spend may go from being `spent` and unconfirmed to being
unspent if the transaction spending the UTXO is dropped from the mempool
before being included in a block, at which point the bitcoin fee resolution
and signing process should proceed as if the keep was just terminated.

[[bitcoin-fee]]
===== Dealing with the Bitcoin Fee

The Bitcoin fee used for clients is something all three signers must agree
on, since it is part of the sighash. To agree on a fee, this proposal
suggests adding a single key to the `Extensions.TBTC.BTCRefunds` config
entry, `MaxFeePerVByte`, which is a value in sats per vByte that represents
the maximum fee per vByte this client is willing to pay in refund
transactions. The default for this value should be 75 sats per vByte.

In addition to this configuration-based max fee, if an optional Bitcoin
connection is available (see <<electrs>>), the client should look up the
25-block suggested fee per vByte and, if it is available and nonzero, should
replace the hardcoded max fee with this value. 25 blocks means confirmation
within ~4 hours. The default of 75 sats per vByte is aimed to be slightly
higher than a reasonable value for 25 blocks, though of course fee market
fluctuation can change this at a moment's notice. The 25-block suggested fee
per vByte should be available at the `/fee-estimates` endpoint of the REST
API, which returns a JSON object with the key `"25"` corresponding to this
fee.

Once each client has its max fee, it will proceed with the
<<signing-protocol>>. This protocol involves exchanging the max fees of all
clients and choosing the lowest max fee acceptable to all clients, and using
that as the fee for the final transaction.


[[signing-protocol]]
===== Signing Protocol

The signing protocol proceeds very much like the standard ECDSA signing
protocol, but starts in a different place. In the standard ECDSA signing
protocol, an on-chain `SignatureRequested` event triggers the client to
https://github.com/keep-network/keep-ecdsa/blob/87716e91f225a3c01501ae73a75db83f79230497/pkg/ecdsa/tss/tss.go#L132[join
a broadcast channel] and perform a
https://github.com/keep-network/keep-ecdsa/blob/87716e91f225a3c01501ae73a75db83f79230497/pkg/ecdsa/tss/protocol_ready.go#L24[ready
protocol] to ensure all signers are ready to sign.

During standard signing, the ready protocol communicates a Ready message that
solely carries the sender ID. Once all three clients have received each other's
ready messages, the ready protocol completes and the signing protocol starts.
For liquidation recovery purposes, this ready protocol is the one that is
adjusted. Instead of only announcing sender IDs, the three signers announce a
ready message with three components:

- The sender ID.
- The BTC address to which the sender's share will be sent.
- The max fee per vByte the sender is willing to pay.

Once each client receives the ready messages from the two other nodes, it can
immediately choose the correct fee per vByte from the provided values (see
<<bitcoin-fee>>), construct the sighash (see <<sighash-construction>>) and
proceed into the signing process to sign that sighash. Once a signature is
computed, each client should construct the final transaction (see
<<final-transaction-construction>>) and submit it (see
<<transaction-submission>>).

The retry mechanism for the signing process for liquidation recovery should be
identical to regular signing, repeating every 2 minutes that a signature has
not been completed successfully until the liquidation recovery timeout. Unlike
standard signing, the liquidation recovery timeout should be very long to allow
for node malfunctions to recover cleanly: this RFC recommends a default timeout
of 7 days.

[[transaction-submission]]
==== Submitting the Signed Transaction

Submitting a signed Bitcoin transaction requires a connection to a Bitcoin
node, direct or indirect. To avoid _strictly requiring_ a connection to a
Bitcoin node, this RFC proposes logging the signed transaction 5 times on the
WARN level with a descriptive prefix. Current operator guidance suggests that
more than 5 WARN level logs within 5 minutes should trigger a notification
for closer monitoring by operators, ensuring these logs will be noticed. The
descriptive prefix will further allow for targeted notifications by operators
so that they can flag these logs for follow-up action.

The suggested structure of the log message is:

```
2020-02-01T12:12:12.12-0800    WARN   keep-ecdsa   Please broadcast Bitcoin transaction 0010010101000828181124af234gbawed000
```

The first three components are the standard components emitted by the ECDSA
client's logging library, while the message itself begins with `Please broadcast
Bitcoin transaction`, followed by the hexadecimal string representing the signed
transaction. The signed transaction can be broadcast via manual submission to a
known node, via API access to a service provider like BlockCypher or
Blockstream, or via a manual form submission on a page like
https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/pushtx/ .

If an optional Bitcoin node connection is available (see <<electrs>>), the
client should attempt to publish the transaction by performing an HTTP POST
request to path `/tx`. The POST request body should be the signed transaction
hex, as would be logged in the WARN logs above. If the POST fails, the client
should log an error and then fall back on the WARN logging above.

=== Implementation

There are a few implementation details that are worth calling out; in
particular, the *pub address derivation, the deposit output script
construction, the Bitcoin sighash construction, the Bitcoin transaction
construction, and the attachment of the signature to the Bitcoin transaction.
This proposal suggests this be done using the `btcsuite` series of Go
libraries, and each one is detailed below with draft code using those
libraries.

[[output-script]]
==== Deposit Output Script Construction

tBTC deposits always use Witness PubKeyHash in their funding UTXO. This means
that, to spend the funding UTXO, the deposit signing group must sign a sighash
that allows spending that UTXO. The signing process does this by including a
`scriptCode` as part of the the sighash (see <<sighash-construction>>). The
`scriptCode`, for Witness PubKeyHash transactions, is defined in BIP143.

This function constructs the relevant `scriptCode` bytes from the deposit's
public key:

```go
// import "github.com/btcsuite/btcd/btcec"
// import "github.com/btcsuite/btcutil"

// PublicKeyToP2WPKHOutputScript converts a public key to a Bitcion p2wpkh
// witness scriptCode that can spend an output sent to that public key's
// corresponding address.
//
// [BIP141]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki
func PublicKeyToP2WPKHScriptCode(
  publicKey *ecdsa.PublicKey,
  chainParams *chaincfg.Params,
) ([]byte, error) {
  // ecdsa.PublicKey and btcec.PublicKey are both method attachments to
  // Go's crypto/ecdsa.PublicKey, so we can cast.
	publicKeyBytes := (*btcec.PublicKey)(publicKey).SerializeCompressed()
  // Note that the scriptCode for a p2wpkh address is the equivalent of the
  // p2pkh scriptPubKey.
  pubKeyAddress, err := btcutil.NewAddressPubKey(publicKeyBytes, chainParams)
  if (err != nil) {
    return fmt.Errorf(
      "error deriving p2wpkh scriptCode from public key: [%s]",
      err,
    )
  }
  pkhAddress := pubKeyAddress.AddressPubKeyHash()

  script, err := txscript.PayToAddrScript(pkhAddress)
  if (err != nil) {
    return fmt.Errorf(
      "error deriving p2wpkh scriptCode from public key: [%s]",
      err,
    )
  }
  if (len(script) > 255) {
    return fmt.Errorf(
      "error deriving p2wpkh scriptCode from public key: [scriptCode too long]",
      len(script)
    )
  }

  return append([]byte{byte(len(script))}, script)
}
```

==== Derivation of Bitcoin Addresses from Extended Public Keys

For best-practice Bitcoin support, this RFC requires that recovery addresses,
as specified in <<recovery-address>>, can be specified as extended public
keys. Extended public keys are generally prefixed by the string `xpub`, as
defined in BIP32. Two additional prefixes are possible: `ypub` is defined in
BIP49 and `zpub` is defined in BIP84.

The `github.com/btcsuite/btcutil/hdkeychain` package handles the key
derivation requirements; however, it always returns BIP44 addresses. As
such, some special handling is needed to detect `ypub` and `zpub` prefixes
and generate the appropriate address types (p2sh and p2wpkh, respectively).
While using the *pub prefix to indicate the address type is not ideal, and
other approaches are used in a few places, they are outside the scope of this
RFC.

Each *pub should come already set to the root path that addresses should
originate at (e.g. `m/0'/0'` for the first account in BIP32 bitcoin-core
wallets, `m/44'/0'/0'` for the first account in BIP44 wallets, and so on).
Addresses are derived as external chain addresses, i.e. at subpath `/0`.

Here is a sample function that could be used to implement this functionality
using the `hdkeychain` package and its relatives:

```go
// import "github.com/btcsuite/btcd/btcec"
// import "github.com/btcsuite/btcutil"

// DeriveAddress uses the specified extended public key and address index to
// derive an address string in the appropriate format at the specified address
// index. The extended public key is expected to already be at the account path
// level (e.g. m/44'/0'/0' for [BIP44] xpubs), and addresses are derived within
// the external chain subpath (`/0`). Thus, calling DeriveAddress with an xpub
// generated at m/44'/0'/0' and passing the address index 5 will produce the
// address at path m/44'/0'/0'/0/5.
//
// In cases where the extended public key is at depth 4, meaning the external or
// internal chain is already included, DeriveAddress will directly derive the
// address index at the existing depth.
//
// The returned address will be a p2pkh/p2sh address for prefixes xpub and tpub,
// (i.e. prefixed by 1, m, or n), a p2wpkh-in-p2sh address for prefixes ypub or
// upub (i.e., prefixed by 3 or 2), and a bech32 p2wpkh address for prefixes
// zpub or vpub (i.e., prefixed by bc1 or tb1).
//
// See [BIP32], [BIP44], [BIP49], and [BIP84] for more on address derivation,
// particular paths, etc.
//

  extendedKey, err := hdkeychain.NewKeyFromString(extendedPublicKey)

[[sighash-construction]]
==== Construction of Sighash for Signing

The sighash is constructed as the double-SHA256 of the preimage. The preimage
is defined in BIP143. The sample function below shows the high level needed
to construct the sighash, which is the data then signed by the signer group
to produce a valid transaction (see the section on
<<final-transaction-construction>> for the rest of the process):

```go
// import "bytes"
// import "crypto/sha256"
// import "encoding/binary"

// Output is a simplified Bitcoin transaction output that contains a value and a
// string address.

}

func doubleSha256(bytes []byte) []byte {

}
```

[[final-transaction-construction]]
==== Construction of Final Transaction

The final transaction can be constructed from information about the
previous transaction, a fee per vbyte, a set of recipient addresses,
and a precomputed signature and public key for the funding UTXO. The
sample function below shows the various inputs as well as how they can
be combined to produce the final transaction hex string that can then
be submitted to the chain:

```go
func BuildTransactionHexString(
	previousOutputTransactionHashHex string, // <1>
	previousOutputIndex uint32,
	previousOutputValue int64, // <2>
	feePerVbyte int64, // <3>
	recipientAddresses []string,
	signature *ecdsa.Signature, // <4>
	publicKey *ecdsa.PublicKey, // <5>
	chainParams *chaincfg.Params, // <6>
) (string, error) {
    // If the previous output transaction hash is passed as a []byte, can use
    // chainhash.NewHash.

		previousOutputTransactionHashHex,
	)
	if err != nil {
		return "", fmt.Errorf(
			"error extracting outpoint transaction hash: [%s]",
			previousOutputTransactionHash,
		)
	}

	)
	txIn.Sequence = 0
	tx.AddTxIn(txIn)

	for _, recipientAddress := range recipientAddresses {
		address, err := btcutil.DecodeAddress(recipientAddress, chainParams)
		if err != nil {
			return "", fmt.Errorf(
				"error decoding output address [%s]: [%s]",
				recipientAddress,
				err,
			)

<1> These two come from `fundingInfo().utxoOutpoint`, which has the transaction
    id as the first 32 little-endian bytes and the previous output index as
    its last 4 little-endian bytes.
<2> Comes from `fundingInfo().utxoValue`, a little-endian unsigned int.
<3> Derived as part of the <<signing-protocol>>.
<4> Computed via the <<signing-protocol>>.
<5> Available on the signer directly (see

=== Limitations

Bitcoin fees, additional dependencies, transaction submission.

== Open Questions

Why not invert this? A single loop monitoring for each of these
events and checking against locally handled keeps.

== Optional Electrs REST API Server

The proposal <<Goal>> section proposes avoiding a strict requirement for a
Bitcoin node; however, several parts of the proposal feature an optional
dependency on an Electrs REST API server. This server should be expected to
adhere to the
https://github.com/Blockstream/esplora/blob/master/API.md[Blockstream electrs
REST API], currently implemented by the
https://github.com/Blockstream/electrs/[Blockstream fork of electrs]. This fork
is open source and has a Docker image available; it must be connected to a
bitcoind instance.

To configure this, the `Extensions.TBTC.ElectrsURL` key can be set to the
appropriate URL. This configuration option should default to
`https://blockstream.info/api/`, but the operator should be allowed to be set
it to a blank string to disable integration altogether.
