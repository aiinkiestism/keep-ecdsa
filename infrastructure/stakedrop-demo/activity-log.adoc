# Stakedrop Demo Activity Log

This activty log contains step-by-step actions to go from a new Ethereum account to running a staked keep-ecdsa-client on the Ropsten testnet.


## Things You Need

. Text editor.
. An internet connection.
. https://metamask.io/[Metamask] and compatible web browser. (Chrome, Firefox, Brave).
. An Ethereum account with keyfile and password for the account. https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/install-and-build/installing-geth[Geth] was used with this demo.
. Some amount of Ropsten ETH.  https://faucet.metamask.io/[Metamask faucet].
. https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker].


## Activity Log

. **Create stakedrop-demo directory**
  .. `mkdir -p stakedrop-demo/config stakedrop-demo/persistence`

. **Create keep-ecdsa-client files**
  .. `cd stakedrop-demo/config`
  .. `touch config.toml keep-ecdsa-operator-account-address.txt keep-ecdsa-operator-account-keyfile keep-ecdsa-operator-account-password.txt`
  ... Final directory structure:

    2 directories, 4 files
  
. **Create ETH account**
  .. Put your account password in the `keep-ecdsa-operator-account-password.txt` file created in step 2.   Put just the password text on the first line, no other comments in  the file.
  .. `cd stakedrop-demo/config`
  .. `geth account new --keystore . --password keep-ecdsa-operator-account-password.txt`
  .. Copy generated account address to file `keep-ecdsa-operator-account-address.txt`.  Prefix the output address with `0x`.
  ... `0x91c9122ee29ab47908f00dc2cafaa41454f1722f`
  
  .. Copy generated keyfile (`UTC--...`) to file `keep-ecdsa-operator-account-keyfile`. 
  ... `cp UTC--2020-06-07T18-07-48.709606000Z--91c9122ee29ab47908f00dc2cafaa41454f1722f keep-ecdsa-operator-account-keyfile`

. **Import your account into Metamask**
  .. https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489331-Importing-an-Account[ Visual Instructions]
  .. Select `JSON File` as import option.
  .. Choose the `keep-ecdsa-operator-account-keyfile` prepared earlier as the JSON file.
  .. Copy/Paste the password in `keep-ecdsa-operator-account-password.txt`.

. **Get a KEEP token grant**
.. link:../../docs/run-keep-ecdsa.adoc#82-testnet[Documentation]
.. `https://us-central1-keep-test-f3e0.cloudfunctions.net/keep-faucet-ropsten?account=0x91c9122ee29ab47908f00dc2cafaa41454f1722f` From Browser.  Results in Ethereum transaction.
... Expected Output:
    
    Created token grant with 300000000000000000000000 KEEP for account: 0x91c9122ee29ab47908f00dc2cafaa41454f1722f
    You can follow the transaction at https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0x71129ec72b54529ee96298a87a734df3275baf92b918d6d48b6b8394ef2addc7
    You can manage your token grants at: https://dashboard.test.keep.network.

. **Delegate a stake from your grant**
.. https://keep-network.gitbook.io/staking-documentation/how-to-stake/how-to-get-staking-after-tge[Visual Instructions]
.. https://dashboard.test.keep.network
.. Log in via metamask
.. Select your account imported in the previous step
.. Delegate at least `100k` KEEP with `authorizer`, `beneficiary`, `operator` set as your generated account from step 3.  Results in Ethereum transaction.

. **Authorize operator contracts**
.. https://keep-network.gitbook.io/staking-documentation/how-to-stake/how-to-authorize-contracts[Visual Instructions]
.. Click `Authorize` for `BondedECDSAKeepFactory`.  Results in Ethereum Transaciton.
.. Click `Authorize` for `TBTCSystem`. Results in Ethereum Transaction.

. **Add ETH for bondng**
.. https://keep-network.gitbook.io/staking-documentation/how-to-stake/how-to-add-eth-for-bonding[Visual Instructions]
.. Click `Add ETH`, add some nominal amount.  `0.5` used for demo.  Results in Ethereum Transaction.

. **Prepare `keep-ecdsa-client` configuration file**
.. See link:../../docs/run-keep-ecdsa.adoc#application[Application Configuration] for template.
.. Testnet contract addresses can be found link:../../docs/run-keep-ecdsa.adoc#823-contracts[here].
.. See `/stakedrop-demo/config/config.toml` for prepared example.

. Get latest Ropsten keep-ecdsa-client Docker iamge
.. `docker pull keepnetwork/keep-ecdsa-client:v1.0.0`

. **Start keep-ecdsa-client**
.. cd `/stakedrop-demo`
.. Run:
```
export KEEP_ECDSA_OPERATOR_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD=$(cat ./config/keep-ecdsa-operator-account-password.txt)
export KEEP_ECDSA_CONFIG_DIR=$(pwd)/config
export KEEP_ECDSA_PERSISTENCE_DIR=$(pwd)/persistence

docker run \
--entrypoint keep-ecdsa \
--volume $KEEP_ECDSA_PERSISTENCE_DIR:/mnt/keep-ecdsa-client/persistence \
--volume $KEEP_ECDSA_CONFIG_DIR:/mnt/keep-ecdsa-client/config \
--env KEEP_ETHEREUM_PASSWORD=$KEEP_ECDSA_OPERATOR_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD \
--env LOG_LEVEL=info \
-p 3919:3919 \
keepnetwork/keep-ecdsa-client:v1.0.0 --config /mnt/keep-ecdsa-client/config/config.toml start
